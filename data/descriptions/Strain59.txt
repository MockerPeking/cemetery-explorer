David Strain (1823-1844) [Section 76 Lot 46]
The first interment in Albany Rural Cemetery 
David Strain was born on October 27, 1823. He was the son of Joseph Strain, a manufacturer of soap and candles at 54 Church Street. His family home would be at 63 Church Street. Their summer home was located in Menands which would later serve as the Home for Aged Men and currently the New York State Council of Nonprofits. 

David would die on October 24, 1844, a few days shy of his 21st birthday. The cause of his death would be consumption, later referred to as tuberculous. A poem in the newspaper the Albany Argus suggests that he may have traveled abroad to treatment as fresh air and sunshine are used as treatments for the disease; “Sleep on, it seems but yesterday, Thou wert in foreign lands, Where thou wert met by glowing hearts, And more than friendly hands. When all the spells their love had tried Could not thy health restore, Weary and faint, you dared the sea To reach thy home once more (sic).”

His death would be a few weeks after the consecration of the cemetery and would have most likely ended up in a receiving vault at the old State Street Burying Grounds, currently Washington Park. 

In May 1845 David’s body would travel to Albany Rural Cemetery, which was not complete at the time, and become the first body interred. David would be interred alongside his sister, Rebecca, who died in 1829, and Isabelle Strain, possibly an aunt who died in 1819. A monument was erected for the Strain family plot by John Dixon, an Albany marble cutter who did all of his work with a hammer and chisel. On the monument reads “first internment and monument in this cemetary (sic).” However, a July 22, 1845 account in the Albany Argus by “The Boston Traveller” mentions that there was no monument in the cemetery at this time, which suggest that the memorial came later on.
