Rosanna Vosburgh (1800-1884) [Section 53 Lot 12]
    Well respected servant.    

Rosanna Vosburg was born on June 17, 1800. It is unknown who her parents were or where she came from. However, as many estates in the Albany area had slaves, Rosanna may have come from a household whose descendant was that of Abraham Vosburgh, one of the original settlers of Rensselaerwyck. As slavery become unfashionable in the region starting in the early 19th century, she may have left the estate seeking work in Albany. 
When Rosanna was 21, she would go to work for Thomas Olcott, president of the Mechanic    s & Farmer    s Bank of Albany. She would have been with the family when they purchased the Ten Broeck Mansion in 1848. They would rename the area to Arbour Hill, which became a popular area to live in Albany.

It is unknown if she had any children or was married, but would live with the family inside their home given census records of the Olcott family. She would have been well respected by the Olcott family as there is a daguerreotype of her. Rosanna is buried with the Olcott Family plot and not the section dedicated to African-Americans. Though her grave is somewhat apart from the family her grave reads     for 63 years a faithful colored servant in the family of Thomas W. Olcott.    Upon her death on September 25, 1884, she would leave her estate to Dudley Olcott, who would later serve as Treasurer and President of the Albany Rural Cemetery.
