Catherine “Kate” Hamilton (1781-1847) [Sec 5 Lot 23]
Originally buried in a vault which became unstable, it was replaced with a stone marker.


Catherine Hamilton was the wife of former lawyer and Albany alderman Isaac Hamilton. Their residence was on Lydius Street, later changed to become part of today’s Madison Avenue.  Upon her death in 1847, (three years after the consecration of the cemetery). Catherine had 2 final wishes. First, the creation of a permanent maintenance fund to care for her final resting place, and Second, to be buried in a private vault.  Her will specified that the vault should be covered with vines, the vaults lock be filled with lead, and the keys thrown into the Hudson River.  Service accounts indicate that her wishes were granted.
In the years following her death rumors spread that she was buried with large sums of cash. To this, numerous attempts to break into her vault proved unsuccessful. However, in 1868 grave robbers were able to break in via controlled explosives which broke though the lock as well as a brick wall. They were unsuccessful in breaking into her tomb. The damage of the burglary lead to the vault being structurally unsound and was removed after 1940. Today a stone marker bearing her name and year of death is all that remain.
