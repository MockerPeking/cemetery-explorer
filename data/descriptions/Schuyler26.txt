Captain Samuel Schuyler (1781-1841) [Section 59 Lot 66]
Black pioneer, shipping company owner

Samuel Schuyler was born on October 20, 1781. Known as “the black Schuylers,” His origins are unknown, however, given his surname, it is speculated that he may have once been enslaved by General Philip Schuyler, “the white Schulyers,” who had the largest amount of slaves in Albany. Slavery was started to decline in Albany County in the early nineteenth century. 

The 1804 records from Albany County show a slave named Sam who purchased his freedom from Derek Schuyler. In 1805 another record indicated a marriage of a Samuel to Mary Martin. He would have at least eight children with her, one of them baptized in Albany Dutch church. His family would live at 204 South Pearl Street. They would live in the South End, Albany’s earliest post-American Revolution black settlement. 

He would work on the docks and eventually as a towboat operator, and 1809 the Albany tax roll mentions Samuel Schuyler as a “Blackman” and “skipper.” He would establish the Schuyler Towboat Company which would run from Albany – New York City. His sons would eventually enter into the family business and rename it to Samuel Schuyler & Company. 
Samuel Schuyler would be seen as a figure of black society in Albany as they would eventually own a coal yard, as well as a flour and feed store. When he died in 1842, his location within the cemetery significant as he, and eventually his family, was not buried in the section designed for African-Americans. Additionally, the granite monument signifies his family’s wealth. The memorial is engraved with three chain links, which is significant with the Odd Fellows as well as an anchor to acknowledge his career along the Hudson River.
